# Algorithms and Data Structures Coursework

Task of this coursework was to create a noughts and crosses game in C with features such as a computer opponent, the ability to replay past games, an undo and redo button to correct mistakes.  


### Aims:
* Gain knowledge of data structures by using them to store the data required for the features of the game
* Improve knowledge of algorthims by implementing a computer opponent for players to play against
* Justify choises of which algorithms and data structures used in a written report
